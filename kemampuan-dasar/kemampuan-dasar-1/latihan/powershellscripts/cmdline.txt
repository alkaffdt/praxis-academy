$ timeout --help
Usage: timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
  or:  timeout [OPTION]
Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
      --preserve-status
                 exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the
                   command times out
      --foreground
                 when not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,
                   allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get TTY signals;
                   in this mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out
  -k, --kill-after=DURATION
                 also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running
                   this long after the initial signal was sent
  -s, --signal=SIGNAL
                 specify the signal to be sent on timeout;
                   SIGNAL may be a name like 'HUP' or a number;
                   see 'kill -l' for a list of signals
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix:
's' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.

If the command times out, and --preserve-status is not set, then exit with
status 124.  Otherwise, exit with the status of COMMAND.  If no signal
is specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout.  The TERM signal kills
any process that does not block or catch that signal.  It may be necessary
to use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught, in which
case the exit status is 128+9 rather than 124.

GPRESULT [/S system [/U username [/P [password]]]] [/SCOPE scope]
           [/USER targetusername] [/R | /V | /Z]

Description:
    This command line tool displays the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP)
    information for a target user and computer.

Parameter List:
    /S        system           Specifies the remote system to connect to.

    /U        [domain\]user    Specifies the user context under which the
                               command should execute.
    /P        [password]       Specifies the password for the given user
                               context. Prompts for input if omitted.
    /SCOPE    scope            Specifies whether the user or the
                               computer settings needs to be displayed.
                               Valid values: "USER", "COMPUTER".

    /USER     [domain\]user    Specifies the user name for which the
                               RSOP data is to be displayed.

    /R                         Displays RSoP summary data.

    /V                         Specifies that verbose information should
                               be displayed. Verbose information provides
                               additional detailed settings that have
                               been applied with a precedence of 1.

    /Z                         Specifies that the super-verbose
                               information should be displayed. Super-
                               verbose information provides additional
                               detailed settings that have been applied
                               with a precedence of 1 and higher. This
                               allows you to see if a setting was set in
                               multiple places. See the Group Policy
                               online help topic for more information.

TAKEOWN [/S system [/U username [/P [password]]]]
        /F filename [/A] [/R [/D prompt]]

Description:
    This tool allows an administrator to recover access to a file that
    was denied by re-assigning file ownership.

Parameter List:
    /S           system          Specifies the remote system to
                                 connect to.

    /U           [domain\]user   Specifies the user context under
                                 which the command should execute.

    /P           [password]      Specifies the password for the
                                 given user context.
                                 Prompts for input if omitted.

    /F           filename        Specifies the filename or directory
                                 name pattern. Wildcard "*" can be used
                                 to specify the pattern. Allows
                                 sharename\filename.

    /A                           Gives ownership to the administrators
                                 group instead of the current user.

    /R                           Recurse: instructs tool to operate on
                                 files in specified directory and all
                                 subdirectories.

                                 does not have the "list folder" permission
                                 on a directory.  This occurs while operating
                                 recursively (/R) on sub-directories. Valid
                                 values "Y" to take ownership or "N" to skip.

    /?                           Displays this help message.

    NOTE: 1) If /A is not specified, file ownership will be given to the
             current logged on user.

          2) Mixed patterns using "?" and "*" are not supported.

          3) /D is used to suppress the confirmation prompt.

leases for all adapters bound to TCP/IP will be released or renewed.

For Setclassid and Setclassid6, if no ClassId is specified, then the ClassId is removed.
